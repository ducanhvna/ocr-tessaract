# Overview
### Intersection over Union for object detection

In the remainder of this blog post I’ll explain what the Intersection over Union evaluation metric is and why we use it.

I’ll also provide a Python implementation of Intersection over Union that you can use when evaluating your own custom object detectors.

Finally, we’ll look at some actual results of applying the Intersection over Union evaluation metric to a set of ground-truth and predicted bounding boxes.
